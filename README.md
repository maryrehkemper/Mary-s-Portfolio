### About Me
I am currently a Sophomore here at Loyola. I am a Bio Psych major in hopes of becoming an occupational therapist. I am on the Womens Lacrosse team and play defense. 
My skills include working in Microsoft Excel workbooks with pie, scatter, bar, and line graphs, coding in Python, and working in Microsoft Access comparing and connecting tables of data.

#### Project 1: Python Course Grade Calculator

This is my Course Grade Calculator that I coded through Python! I struggled a lot with the Python module, but I chose to display this project because once I understood Python, I was super proud of myself and can understand why people find coding useful in the real world. This Course Grade Calculator allows someone to enter their desires quiz and assesment weights adding up to 100, and then enter their 4 quiz scores and assesment scores to add up their final grade overall. I found this very useful and tried to use it to calculate my current course grades everall! The biggest obstacle I came across was connecting the overall grade letter with the overall percentage of the grade. Even hough the Python module was a challenge for me, by the end of it I really got the hang of it and found it kind of fun to code!

#### Project 2: Microsoft Access Queries

This is my Quarie comparing customers in ascending order that I created through Microsoft Access! I loved this Microsoft Access module, and I can see myself using this in the real world. In this project, I connected two tables by using a quarie. I connected the two tables by the customer and their Student ID. I struggled a little bit connecting the correct piece of information between the two tables, but once I connected the right thing it worked perfectly. This Microsoft Access module was my favorite module!

#### Project 3: Microsoft Access Project Transcripts

These are two students project transcripts that I created through Microsoft Access! These grades consist of their fall and spring courses. The grades add up to their average GPA. I struggled getting the average of their GPA and that being put on the actual transcript, but it turned out to just be something wrong with my own Microsoft Access. I really enjoyed this project because it was cool to create a transcript that looked exactly the same to what I recieved in elementary and middle school. I learned to appreciate using Microsoft Access in the real world, because I can see how teachers use this.
